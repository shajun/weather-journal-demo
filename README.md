# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview

First, this project is cloned from [the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree program](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/weather-journal-app).

Second, this project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## Instructions

This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file.

1. The `website/app.js` file is used to get API data from openweathermap website and post to server.js endpoint.
2. After the `server` gets the data in the client's POST request, it adds it to the application endpoint, projectData.

## Extras

I modified the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file according to the project requirements.

After you clone this project, go to the project root directory and execute `node ./server.js`
